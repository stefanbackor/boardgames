        If there are at least 3 crystals in the Drillâ€™s cargo area , it moves
        towards the closest Forge; otherwise it moves to a mountain without a
        Forge (if possible). If there are multiple eligible mountains, it moves
        to the one with a larger Ironclad Warband and/or with the smaller
        Woodwalker Warband adjacent. If there is no adjacent mountain with an
        Ironclad Warband on it, the Drill moves to a mountain that is adjacent
        to a larger Ironclad Warband. In case of a tie, use the{' '}

        When moving to a mountain without a Forge, advance on the Drill track
